## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Antony, a self-taught full stack web developer based in the UK

I enjoy building web apps that feel fast, work for everyone, and are simple to use and maintain. With a background in photo, video and graphic design, I care about turning visual ideas into functional, accessible applications.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually gaming, watching movies, playing guitar, or taking photos. I also love travelling and exploring new cultures.

Fun Facts:

â€¢ I try to visit a new country every year, ideally somewhere with good food and even better photo ops.

â€¢ My game backlog is growing faster than I can play... but I still pretend Iâ€™ll finish them all someday.
